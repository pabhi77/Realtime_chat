Real-Time Chat Application
This project is a real-time chat application built using React for the front end and Node.js with Express for the back end. It allows users to chat with each other in real time through instant messaging, with messages being displayed to all participants in the chat as soon as they are sent. This is achieved using Socket.IO for real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server.

Features:
Real-time messaging: Users can send and receive messages instantly.
User authentication: Users can log in and authenticate themselves before joining a chat.
Multiple chat rooms: Users can join different chat rooms to communicate with specific groups.
Typing indicators: See when other users are typing in the chat.
Message history: Previous messages are displayed when users join a room.
Online status: Shows which users are currently online.
